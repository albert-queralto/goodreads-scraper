# Goodreads scraping tool
This tool obtains metadata information from *Best Books Ever* list on [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) and saves the information to a CSV file.

This tool was intended as a practice for webscraping and to learn how to use the [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) libraries.

An *object-oriented-programming* approach was used to implement the scraping tool.

To run the tool, you need to install the following packages:

- [Python 3.9 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Selenium 4.4](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
